# Day 3 exercises (Java socket programming)
This project is an all in one.
To connect type jdbh.dk 9999<br>
It looks weird because i styled it for netbeans... So you could also run clientTest and remember to set the ip to jdbh.dk
### options
TIME# - shows the time<br>
UPPER#text - converts text to uppercase<br>
LOWER#text - convert text to lowercase<br>
REVERSE#text - reverses the text<br>
TRANSLATE#text translate the text (hund, fisk, fugl, kat)<br>
MSGALL#text - sends a message to all clients.
EXIT# - exits. You should use this everytime, since I have not handled the the client count properly.
